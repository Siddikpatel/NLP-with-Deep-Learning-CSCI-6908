    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will build, train, and evaluate a neural machine translation system. The system will be in the form of a seq2seq neural network, that takes as input a French sequence and translates it to English. Unlike the previous assignment where the whole system was built from scratch, you will now use `pytorch`, a Python framework for building deep learning models.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment assumes some familiarity with the framework. You can consult `pytorch`'s [documentation](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) to brush up on your knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goals of this assignment are:  \n",
    "  - Train a BPE-based tokenizer to transform input from raw textual representation in an adequate one that can serve as input for the neural model.\n",
    "  - Use Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) as building blocks to create a seq2seq model for neural machine translation.\n",
    "  - Build different variations of seq2seq models for French-to-English translation.\n",
    "  - Evaluate said models using machine-translation metrics such as BLEU."

    "## Requirements\n",
    "Before you can start, make sure you install the dependencies list in the `requirements.txt` file. It is advised that you use a Python virtual enviornment. You can consult how you can a add virtual enviornment to Jupyter's kernal through this [guide](https://janakiev.com/blog/jupyter-virtual-envs/).  \n",
    "In this assignment you will train two seq2seq models for a duration $25K$ steps (not epochs). On a Mabook Pro with an M2 chip, the training time took $\\sim 50$ minutes and $90$ minutes respectively. If you do not have access to enough computational resources here are your options:\n",
    "- Use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n",
    "- Use Dal's Brookside and Calvert [servers](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/computerscience/for-faculty-staff/technical-services.html). Check under _Academic compute enviornment_ > _GPU Processing_. There you will find links that redirect you to the Jupyter lab interface hosted on these servers.\n",
    "- Reduce the number of training step.\n",

    "**Please note that your grade will depend on the implementation and not on the running results. Hence, if you cannot train these models fully, you can still get the full grade if your implementation is correct.**\n",

    "Add the TA as _Maintainer_ to your fork and submit your fork's URL on Brightspace. Push the modifications you have made on this notebook to your fork.  \n",

    "## Submission of SDAs\n",
    "For this assignment, SDAs should be submitted through Brightspace. You will find the submission box under _Assignments_ > _SDA_. **<span style=\"color:red\">Please note that you are only allowed to submit 2 SDAs for this course. Hence, if you already reached that limit, you can no longer submit one. In addition, no SDA will be considered if sent by email.

    "The dataset contains $\\sim 259K$ pairs of French and English sequences. It is taken from the work of [(Tiedemann, 2012)](https://aclanthology.org/L12-1246/). The dataset is stored in `data/data.txt`. Each line follows this form: `<ENGLISH-SENTENCE> \\t <FRENCH-SENTENCE>`.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) is a data compression technique adapted for use in neural machine translation to handle the vocabulary of words in a text corpus. In NMT, we use BPE to segment words into subword units (_i.e._, tokens), which helps in managing rare and out-of-vocabulary words by breaking them down into smaller, more frequent components. For instance, instead of treating the word `eating` as a part of the vocabulary, we subdivide into `eat` and `ing` and treat these tokens as part of the vocab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how BPE works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: Start with a vocabulary of individual characters.\n",
    "2. **Frequency Counting**: Count the frequency of each pair of adjacent symbols (initially characters) in the text.\n",
    "3. **Merging**: Replace the most frequent pair with a new symbol and add it to the vocabulary.\n",
    "4. **Iteration**: Repeat the counting and merging steps until a predefined vocabulary size is reached or no more pairs can be merged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iteratively, BPE creates a set of subword units that can represent any word in the text, even if it was not seen during training. This approach helps in reducing the vocabulary size while maintaining the ability to generate and understand rare or complex words, improving the efficiency and performance of neural machine translation models.  \n",

    "   - The decoder uses a **GRUCell** to generate output tokens **step-by-step**:  \n",

To address this, you will enhance the decoder by integrating an attention mechanism. Unlike the vanilla model, which relies solely on a fixed context vector from the encoder, attention allows the decoder to dynamically \"focus\" on relevant parts of the input sequence at each decoding step. This step equips the model with the ability to better align input and output sequences, improving translation quality and robustness.
