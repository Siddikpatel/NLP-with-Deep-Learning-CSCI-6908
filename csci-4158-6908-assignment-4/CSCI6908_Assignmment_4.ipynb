    "During the lecture, you have covered the Transformers architecture. Such architecture represents the backbone of many state-of-the-art large language models. In this assignment you will implement from scratch a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, which is nothing but a decoder-only Transformer. You will implement from scratch using `pytorch` the different building blocks that constitute the GPT model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment assumes some familiarity with the framework. You can consult `pytorch`'s [documentation](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) to brush up on your knowledge.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The main goals of this assignment are:  \n",
    "  - Implement the Causal Self-Attention layer and use it to form the Multihead-Attention block.\n",
    "  - Implement contemporary activation functions used in modern day language models.\n",
    "  - Implement the GPT model and its subcomponents.\n",
    "  - Pre-train a generative model from scratch."

    "## Requirements\n",
    "Before you can start, make sure you install the dependencies list in the `requirements.txt` file. It is advised that you use a Python virtual enviornment. You can consult how you can a add virtual enviornment to Jupyter's kernal through this [guide](https://janakiev.com/blog/jupyter-virtual-envs/).  \n",
    "In this assignment you will train a GPT model for a duration of at least $20K$ steps (not epochs). If you do not have access to enough computational resources here are your options:\n",
    "- Use a configuration that yields a smaller GPT model. For instance, use only $4$ layers instead of $6$.\n",
    "- Use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n",
    "- Use Dal's Brookside and Calvert [servers](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/computerscience/for-faculty-staff/technical-services.html). Check under _Academic compute enviornment_ > _GPU Processing_. There you will find links that redirect you to the Jupyter lab interface hosted on these servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please note that your grade will depend on the implementation and not on the running results. Hence, if you cannot train these models fully, you can still get the full grade if your implementation is correct.**\n",

    "## Submission Guidelines\n",
    "Add the TA as _Maintainer_ to your fork and submit your fork's URL on Brightspace. Push the modifications you have made on this notebook to your fork.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission of SDAs\n",
    "For this assignment, SDAs should be submitted through Brightspace. You will find the submission box under _Assignments_ > _SDA_. **<span style=\"color:red\">Please note that you are only allowed to submit 2 SDAs for this course. Hence, if you already reached that limit, you can no longer submit one. In addition, no SDA will be considered if sent by email. All SDAs should be submitted through Brightspace at least 24 hours prior to the deadline. The PDF file should be following this format: `<BANNER-ID>_<FIRST-NAME>_<LAST_NAME>_<ASSIGNMENT-NUMBER>.pdf`</span>**  \n",

    "\n",
    "The Causal Self-attention layer is a fundamental building block of the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture. This layer consists of several key components that work together to enable the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence while maintaining the autoregressive property. The main components of a causal self-attention head are:  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linear projections: Three separate linear transformations are applied to the input to create the query ($Q$), key ($K$), and value ($V$) matrices: $Q = XW_q, K = XW_k, V = XW_v$ where $X$ is the input tensor, and $W_q$, $W_k$, and $W_v$ are learnable weight matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Scaled dot-product attention: The attention mechanism is computed as: $\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}} + M\\right)V$ where $d_k$ is the dimensionality of the key vectors, and $M$ is the causal mask.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Causal masking: A lower triangular matrix $M$ is applied to ensure that each token can only attend to itself and previous tokens: $M_{ij} = \\begin{cases} 0 & \\text{if } i \\geq j \\ -\\infty & \\text{if } i < j \\end{cases}$\n",
